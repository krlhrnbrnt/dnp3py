"""New point kinds from Annex A groups 13, 31, 33, 34, 41 and 43 are
framed by the wire-level parser, but never reach a decode function or a
handler callback, end to end through ``Master.process_response``: master.py
only batches and decodes a kind with an entry in its delivery table
(``_DELIVERIES``), and none of these new kinds has one. IEEE 1815-2012 Annex A
defines their wire shape; delivery is a separate, later step. One
representative pair per new kind, built with ``struct`` from its own clause
rather than the library's own encoder.
