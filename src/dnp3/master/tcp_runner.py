"""TCP transport runner for DNP3 masters.

`Master` builds requests and parses responses but owns no I/O; `TcpClientChannel`
moves bytes but knows no DNP3. `MasterTcpRunner` is the layer between them:
data link framing, transport segmentation and reassembly, link reset, and the
multi-fragment application CONFIRM handshake.

    runner = MasterTcpRunner(master=Master(handler=handler), host="10.0.0.5")
    await runner.open()
    try:
        await runner.integrity_poll()
    finally:
        await runner.close()

Scheduling deliberately lives *above* this class. `PollScheduler` models when a
poll is due and is transport-independent; driving it from inside a TCP runner
would make a serial or UDP implementation reimplement the loop. `poll(task)`
runs one scheduled task; the loop that decides when to call it is the caller's.

This is not a mirror of `OutstationTcpRunner`. The two share a shape at the link
and transport layers, but the seam between them is better extracted once there
are two real implementations to compare than guessed from one.
