A pure Python implementation of the DNP3 (IEEE 1815-2012) protocol, including a
MESA IEEE 1815.2 DER outstation simulator introduced in v0.2.0.

## Features

- **Pure Python** - No C/C++ dependencies, works anywhere Python runs
- **Level 2 object model** - targets the IEEE 1815-2012 clause 14.4 (Table 14-3)
  subset for RTU-class SCADA use; see [Protocol Conformance](#protocol-conformance)
  for the request rows not yet implemented
- **Async I/O** - Built on asyncio for efficient network communication
- **Type Safe** - Full type annotations with strict mypy compliance
- **Well Tested** - see the CI and codecov badges above for current numbers
- **MESA IEEE 1815.2 Outstation** - Profile-driven DER outstation simulator for
  meters, DERs, inverters, and batteries

## Installation

```bash
pip install dnp3py
```

Or with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

```bash
uv add dnp3py
```

## Quick Start

Run the outstation script in one terminal, then the master script in a
second; both use `127.0.0.1:20000`, so the master's integrity poll returns
the two points the outstation set.

### Outstation (Server)

```python
import asyncio
import logging
from dnp3.database import AnalogInputConfig, BinaryInputConfig, Database
from dnp3.outstation import Outstation, OutstationConfig, OutstationTcpRunner

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

async def main():
    # Create database with points
    database = Database()
    database.add_binary_input(0, BinaryInputConfig())
    database.add_analog_input(0, AnalogInputConfig())

    # Update values
    database.update_binary_input(0, value=True)
    # Static Analog Input transmits as a 32-bit integer by default (g30v1);
    # a fractional value here is silently truncated on the wire.
    database.update_analog_input(0, value=42)

    # Create outstation and run it over TCP
    outstation = Outstation(database=database, config=OutstationConfig(address=1))
    runner = OutstationTcpRunner(outstation=outstation, host="127.0.0.1", port=20000)
    await runner.run()  # serves connections until runner.stop() is called

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Master (Client)

```python
import asyncio
from dnp3.master import DefaultSOEHandler, Master, MasterConfig, MasterTcpRunner

async def main():
    # Create master with event handler
    handler = DefaultSOEHandler()
    master = Master(handler=handler, config=MasterConfig(address=2, outstation_address=1))

    # Connect and perform an integrity poll
    async with MasterTcpRunner(master=master, host="127.0.0.1", port=20000) as runner:
        await runner.integrity_poll()

    print(handler.binary_inputs[0].value)   # True
    print(handler.analog_inputs[0].value)   # 42.0

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Octet strings (master)

```python
import asyncio
from dnp3.master import DefaultSOEHandler, Master, MasterTcpRunner

async def main():
    handler = DefaultSOEHandler()
    master = Master(handler=handler)

    async with MasterTcpRunner(master=master, host="localhost", port=20000) as runner:
        await runner.write_octet_string(2, b"Feeder 7")
        # Variation 0 asks for strings of any length.
        await runner.request(master.build_range_poll(group=110, variation=0, start=0, stop=3))

    name = handler.get_octet_string(2)
    if name is not None:
        print(name.value.decode("ascii"))

asyncio.run(main())
```

The master delivers the raw bytes; DNP3 does not define an encoding for them, so decode them as the device documents.
`write_octet_string()` raises `RequestRejectedError` when the outstation answers that it did not carry out the write.

## MESA IEEE 1815.2 Outstation

The `dnp3.mesa` module is a DER-oriented outstation built on mesa-tool's
PicsProfile format (the companion Rust conformance control station); see
[docs/mesa-outstation.md](docs/mesa-outstation.md) for the format and the
adoption rationale. It supports meters, DERs (distributed energy resources),
inverters, and batteries, including point configuration for counters,
curves, and schedules; it does not implement the periodic counter
self-freeze (#188), curve edit rules, or schedule execution (#191) that
IEEE 1815.2-2025 describes for those point types. You describe the device
by loading a PicsProfile JSON file; the module builds the DNP3 database and
command handler automatically, scaling analog values from engineering units
to DNP3 transmission integers on load.

Four bundled profiles ship inside the package
(`full`, `mandatory_1815`, `mandatory_1547`, `minimal_1547`); `full` is the
default. Profiles are authored as JSON; there is no spreadsheet ingestion
path.

### Quick start (CLI)

```bash
# Run against the bundled full profile (the default)
python -m dnp3.mesa

# Run against a conformance subset
python -m dnp3.mesa --profile-name minimal_1547

# Run a custom profile, limited to the first meter and no DERs/inverters/batteries
python -m dnp3.mesa --profile my_device_profile.json --meters 1 --ders 0 --inverters 0 --batteries 0
```

For the full flag reference and defaults, see
[docs/mesa-outstation.md](docs/mesa-outstation.md).

### Programmatic API

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from dnp3.mesa.outstation import create_mesa_outstation

async def main():
    outstation = create_mesa_outstation(
        profile_path=Path("my_device_profile.json"),
        host="0.0.0.0",
        port=20000,
        address=1,
        master_address=0,
        entity_overrides={"meters": 1, "ders": 0},  # optional
    )
    await outstation.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

`create_mesa_outstation` returns a `MesaOutstation` dataclass. Call
`await outstation.run()` to start the TCP server; call `await outstation.stop()`
to shut it down cleanly.

For a full description of the PicsProfile format, the bundled profiles, the
engineering-to-transmission scaling contract, and CTR/curve/schedule
handling, see [docs/mesa-outstation.md](docs/mesa-outstation.md).

## Protocol Conformance

### Function Codes

`CONFIRM`, `READ`, `WRITE`, `SELECT`, `OPERATE`, `DIRECT_OPERATE`,
`DIRECT_OPERATE_NO_ACK`, `COLD_RESTART`\*, `WARM_RESTART`\*, `DELAY_MEASURE`,
`RECORD_CURRENT_TIME`, `ENABLE_UNSOLICITED`, `DISABLE_UNSOLICITED`,
`IMMEDIATE_FREEZE`\*, `IMMEDIATE_FREEZE_NO_ACK`\*, `FREEZE_CLEAR`\*,
`FREEZE_CLEAR_NO_ACK`\* (IEEE 1815-2012 Clause 4). `*` marks a handler hook
the default handler and the `dnp3.mesa` outstation leave unimplemented:
`COLD_RESTART`/`WARM_RESTART` and a g20 `IMMEDIATE_FREEZE`/`FREEZE_CLEAR`
request answer IIN2.1 (NO_FUNC_CODE_SUPPORT) unless an application
implements the hook, and `IMMEDIATE_FREEZE_NO_ACK`/`FREEZE_CLEAR_NO_ACK`
get no response at all (see Level 2 below). Control commands are covered
in detail, with wire-level request/response encoding, in
[docs/control-commands.md](docs/control-commands.md).

### Object Groups (outstation)

| Group | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1, 2 | Binary Input (static, event) |
| 10 | Binary Output (static) |
| 12 | Control Relay Output Block (select, operate, direct operate) |
| 20, 21, 22 | Counter (static, frozen, event); freezing is a handler hook the default and `dnp3.mesa` handlers refuse, so a master's freeze request freezes nothing (`Database.freeze_counter` still freezes locally) (#199) |
| 30, 32 | Analog Input (static, event) |
| 40, 41 | Analog Output (status, command: select, operate, direct operate) |
| 50 | Time and Date (WRITE g50v1 sets time; WRITE g50v3 sets time from RECORD_CURRENT_TIME, LAN sync) |
| 52 | Time Delay (response to DELAY_MEASURE) |
| 60 | Class data |
| 80 | Internal Indications (WRITE to clear DEVICE_RESTART or NEED_TIME) |

Wire layout follows IEEE 1815-2012 Annex A. The master additionally decodes
and delivers Double-Bit Binary Input (groups 3, 4) from a peer that sends it,
on its own handler callback (`DoubleBitInputHandler`), and Octet String
(groups 110, 111) on `OctetStringHandler`, and writes one g110 string with
`MasterTcpRunner.write_octet_string()`; a few other groups the
wire layout recognizes (command events, frozen analog input, deadband, time)
are framed but not delivered to any handler.

### Level 2 (clause 14.4, Table 14-3)

Time synchronization is implemented for both procedures IEEE 1815-2012
10.3.3 describes. Non-LAN (10.3.3.1): DELAY_MEASURE (function code 23)
answers the outstation's own processing delay (step c), which this
outstation reports as 0 (#146), and a WRITE of g50v1 delivers the written
time to the `time_handler` hook and clears NEED_TIME in its own response.
LAN (10.3.3.2, required of a TCP/IP outstation that sets NEED_TIME per
4.4.16.1 Rule 2): RECORD_CURRENT_TIME (function code 24) records the
receipt instant, and a following WRITE of g50v3 delivers the written time
plus the elapsed time since that instant, and clears NEED_TIME the same way.
A WRITE of g80v1 index 4 also clears NEED_TIME directly (4.5.5).

Event reads against Table 14-3 are incomplete: a g2, g22 or g32 event read
returns all Class 1, 3 or 2 events of any type rather than only events of
that group, so a group's events assigned to a different class are never
returned (#194);
only g2v1 is served, not g2v2 or g2v3 (#195); and limited-quantity
qualifiers 07/08 are ignored (#196). FC 13 COLD_RESTART (#201) and
WARM_RESTART, and the ACK forms of the freeze function codes,
IMMEDIATE_FREEZE (FC 7) and FREEZE_CLEAR (FC 9) (#199), are handler hooks
(see Function Codes above); the default handler and the `dnp3.mesa`
outstation answer COLD_RESTART and WARM_RESTART with IIN2.1
(NO_FUNC_CODE_SUPPORT) unless an application implements the hook, and
answer a g20 freeze request the same way (a request carrying only a g21
header gets no IIN2.1 and freezes nothing, since the hook fires only for a
g20 block). Their NO_ACK forms, IMMEDIATE_FREEZE_NO_ACK
(FC 8) and FREEZE_CLEAR_NO_ACK (FC 10), get no response at all rather than
IIN2.1 (#199). g51 (Time and Date Common Time of Occurrence) appears only in the
response column of Table 14-3 and this outstation reports no relative-time
events that would need it.

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the path to full IEEE 1815.2-2025 conformance.
